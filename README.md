## ABOUT ME 
Hello Everyone. Let me briefly introduce myself to you. First of all I am so glad to see you are looking at my project. My name is Medetcan Diler. I am 26 years old. I am a fresh graduated mechanical engineer. After my graduation I worked as an engineer in field somewhere in the region of 5 months. After That I decided to research on different careers specifically those that include web development. Because I have always been interested in coding, web, computer and its components. After extensive research, I grew more interest towards coding and I felt driven and motivated to become a genuinely brilliant frontend web developer. Before I go I would like to add that my education bacground that engineering has taught me how to work in an higly orginised and systematich way which allows me to learn in an effective way. All of these mean my enginnering background has been making great contrubutions to my learning process. I hope I did not bore you with my brief introduction and also I hope you like my projects.

## About My Italian Cuisine Menu Project
In this project I only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript . The reason for creating these website is improving my knowledge of JavaScrpit arrays, objects, functions, and methods. All menu list came from JavaScript object of array and I created all the DOM elements dynamically. Additionally all responsive design behind my project made by using CSS media rules.It was really entartaining and educational to me.
